This repository contains an independent JavaScript implementation extracted from ken050210's local router. It does not contain a fork of the upstream Go source. The upstream project already supports incremental SSE parsing; this release adds a Vertex-native `partialArgs` bridge so supported requests can deliver text during generation. It is not an official Antigravity Gateway release.

The distribution contains transport and Vertex modules, a standalone HTTP server, tests and documentation. Personal configurations, account routing, runtime state, credentials, conversation data and private repository history are excluded.

Google, Vertex AI, Gemini and SillyTavern are named to describe compatibility. Their maintainers do not endorse this project. The protocol reference is Google's documentation for [streaming function call arguments](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/function-calling#streaming_function_call_arguments).

Text-to-image input is inspired by Antigravity-gateway experimental revision 004067b34f42cd6a9ba9b147a0cad02b88c10c7b (imagectx). This is an independent JavaScript implementation with deliberate compatibility differences. Bundled NotoSansCJKsc-Regular.otf is from https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk/tree/main/Sans/OTF/SimplifiedChinese and is redistributed under the SIL Open Font License in assets/fonts/OFL.txt. @napi-rs/canvas and its platform binaries retain their upstream license notices through npm.

Unicode input's compact `⟦U:…⟧` encoding rules and current-floor matching follow an encoder by 灰鸠「GoldRush」 (the author's online name). They are included with the author's permission, as confirmed by the project maintainer; this repository records no license for the original encoder. This JavaScript implementation matches message text only, deliberately leaves matches inside tags and existing `⟦U:…⟧` blocks of the surrounding text unchanged, and adds no decoding instruction. It is not an official release by the author.
